Hi there! 

I am a Ph.D. student in [LTI](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by [Carolyn Ros√©](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/) and [Maarten Sap](https://maartensap.com/). I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science. 

Previously, I completed my Master's in [Survey and Data Science](https://surveydatascience.isr.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, where I was advised by [Yajuan Si](https://websites.umich.edu/~yajuan/). I conducted research on NLP with [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/) in the [Blablablab](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu/) and also worked with [David Flood](https://ihpi.umich.edu/our-experts/dcflood) as a member of the [HPACC](https://www.hpaccproject.org/) team. Prior to that, I got my Bachelor's at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/) with double majors in Mathematics and Data Science (Computer Science Concentration), where I worked with [Hongyi Wen](https://whongyi.github.io/) on Recommendation Systems.
